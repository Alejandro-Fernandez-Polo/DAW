                        Between 1565 and 1783, the United States underwent a crucial evolution. In 1565, the Spanish
                        founded
                        St. Augustine in Florida, marking the beginning of European presence. British colonization
                        followed
                        at Jamestown in 1607. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the colonies prospered, but
                        tensions
                        with Great Britain increased due to taxes and restrictions. In 1775, the War of Independence
                        began,
                        led by figures such as George Washington. The Declaration of Independence in 1776 marked the
                        formal
                        separation. The war culminated in 1783 with the Treaty of Paris, recognizing the independence of
                        the
                        United States.

                        Between 1783 and 1860, the United States went through an era of growth and conflict. The
                        Constitution was written in 1787, establishing the system of government. Westward expansion
                        accelerated, with the purchase of Louisiana and the Oregon Trail. However, tensions grew over
                        slavery, culminating in the Civil War in 1861. During this period, political parties were
                        formed,
                        Monroe policy was established, and the economy based on agriculture and industrialization
                        developed.
                        The issue of slavery escalated, deeply dividing the country and leading to war.

                        Between 1861 and 1865, the United States faced its most devastating civil war. The dispute over
                        slavery and state rights led to the secession of the southern states, forming the Confederate
                        States. The conflict erupted in 1861 with the Battle of Fort Sumter. President Abraham Lincoln
                        led
                        the Union, seeking to preserve the union and abolish slavery. The Civil War saw bloody clashes
                        such
                        as the Battle of Gettysburg and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclaimed in 1863. The Union prevailed
                        in
                        1865, marking the end of slavery with the ratification of the 13th Amendment and the
                        reunification
                        of the country.

                        After the Civil War in 1865, the United States embarked on Reconstruction to heal divisions. The
                        13th Amendment abolished slavery, but challenges remained. The 14th and 15th Amendments were
                        implemented to grant civil rights and the vote to African Americans. Industrialization emerged,
                        fueled by railroad expansion and economic boom. However, there were labor tensions and conflicts
                        with Native American communities. The gold rush in the West attracted fortune seekers, while
                        racial
                        segregation laws were enacted in the South. The era culminated with the Wounded Knee massacre
                        and
                        the consolidation of industrial power.

                        Between 1890 and 1913, the United States underwent significant changes. Westward expansion was
                        completed, marking the closing of the frontier. The Industrial Revolution transformed the
                        economy,
                        giving rise to large corporations and social change. Progressive activism emerged, advocating
                        reforms in areas such as labor rights and gender equality. Theodore Roosevelt's administration
                        implemented antitrust and conservationist policies. Immigration increased, contributing to
                        cultural
                        diversity. However, racial tensions and labor conflicts also arose, such as the Pullman strike.
                        The
                        era culminated with the presidency of Woodrow Wilson and the entry of the United States into
                        World
                        War I in 1917.

                        Between 1915 and 1929, the United States lived through a period of changes and contrasts.
                        Involvement in World War I (1917-1918) marked the beginning of the period. Subsequently, the
                        1920s
                        became known as the "Roaring Twenties," characterized by economic boom, cultural proliferation
                        and
                        alcohol prohibition. However, prosperity was cut short by the Great Depression in 1929, when the
                        stock market collapsed, triggering a worldwide economic crisis. This period of hardship left a
                        lasting impact on American society and set the stage for subsequent government intervention in
                        the
                        economy.

                        The 1930s in the United States were marked by the Great Depression, triggered by the collapse of
                        the
                        stock market in 1929. Millions of people lost jobs and poverty became widespread. President
                        Franklin
                        D. Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, a set of programs and reforms to combat the crisis. World
                        War
                        II began in Europe in 1939, and although the United States initially remained neutral, its
                        involvement in the conflict from 1941 onward revived the economy and changed the course of world
                        history. The decade ended with the entry of the United States into the war.

                        Between 1941 and 1945, the United States played a crucial role in World War II. Following the
                        Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States entered the conflict. The nation
                        mobilized enormous industrial and human resources to support the Allies. The war in the Pacific
                        and
                        Europe saw decisive battles such as Midway and D-Day. The atomic bomb was used on Hiroshima and
                        Nagasaki in 1945, hastening the end of the conflict. These years marked America's transition to
                        a
                        superpower and the beginning of the Cold War.

                        superpower.
                        The Marshall Plan helped European reconstruction, consolidating U.S. influence. The Cold War
                        with
                        the Soviet Union emerged, marked by the arms race and the space race. In the 1950s, society
                        underwent cultural and political changes, including the struggle for civil rights. Involvement
                        in
                        the Vietnam War generated internal divisions. In 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. The 1970s
                        faced
                        economic, energy and political crises, culminating with the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

                        Camphor is all about easy & relaxed eating, and letting classic French flavors & culinary
                        techniques do the talking. With a menu replete with personal nods to both chefs’ global
                        upbringing, expect a mix of refreshing, refined, yet light fare in a relaxed convivial setting
                        that harkens back to the basics with a shareable feast of small plates, alongside a vast
                        selection of curated wines and curated cocktails to pair.
